            <h2>The History of Films</h2>
            <p>
                The history of films dates back to the late 19th century, with the
                invention of motion picture cameras. The Lumière brothers, Auguste and
                Louis, are often credited with inventing the first practical motion
                picture camera in 1895. Early films were short, silent, and lacked
                sound, but they quickly became a popular form of entertainment.

                In the 1920s, films began to incorporate sound, and in the 1930s, color
                was introduced. Hollywood became the center of the film industry, with
                major studios producing films on a large scale. Today, films are a
                global industry, with millions of people working in various aspects of
                film production, from screenwriting to visual effects.

            The history of film chronicles the development of a visual art form created using film technologies that began in the late 19th century.The advent of film as an artistic medium is not clearly defined. However, the commercial, public screening of ten of the Lumière brothers' short films in Paris on 28 December 1895 can be regarded as the breakthrough of projected cinematographic motion pictures. There had been earlier cinematographic results and screenings by others like the Skladanowsky brothers, who used their self-made Bioscop to display the first moving picture show to a paying audience on 1 November 1895 in Berlin, but they had neither the quality, financial backing, stamina, or the luck to find the momentum that propelled the cinématographe Lumière into worldwide success.[1] Those earliest films were in black and white, under a minute long, without recorded sound and consisted of a single shot from a steady camera.The first decade of motion pictures saw film moving from a novelty to an established mass entertainment industry, with film production companies and studios established all over the world.

Conventions toward a general cinematic language also developed, with editing camera movements and other cinematic techniques contributing specific roles in the narrative of films.


Popular new media, including television (mainstream since the 1950s), home video (mainstream since the 1980s), and internet (mainstream since the 1990s) influenced the distribution and consumption of films. Film production usually responded with content to fit the new media, and with technical innovations (including widescreen (mainstream since the 1950s), 3D and 4D film) and more spectacular films to keep theatrical screenings attractive.

Systems that were cheaper and more easily handled (including 8mm film, video and smartphone cameras) allowed for an increasing number of people to create films of varying qualities, for any purpose (including home movies and video art). The technical quality was usually lower than that of professional movies, but improved with digital video and affordable high quality digital cameras.

Improving over time, digital production methods became more and more popular during the 1990s, resulting in increasingly realistic visual effects and popular feature-length computer animations.

Different film genres emerged and enjoyed variable degrees of success over time, with huge differences among, for instance, horror
